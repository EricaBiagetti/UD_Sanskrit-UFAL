The UD Sanskrit treebank is based on the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS),
http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/. Its morphological annotation was automatically converted to
universal POS tags and features; the result was checked manually while syntactic dependency annotation was
being added.

Only a small sample of the DCS data has been annotated in the Universal Dependencies style (200 sentences).
